## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Layout

The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px
- Desktop: 1440px
